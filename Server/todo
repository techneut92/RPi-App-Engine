- seperate client related stuff into a client manager from msgdistributor
- add tcp connections on port 9737
  - seperate client into 3 classes, 1 to inherit from and a websocket client and a tcp client.
- add validation on apps? (how would i even do that, is it even possible if all the code is open source)
